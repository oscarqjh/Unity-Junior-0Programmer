# Unity-Junior-Programmer

## Introduction

This repository contains the projects I have worked on as a [Unity Junior Programmer](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-1-driving-simulation?uv=2022.3&pathwayId=5f7e17e1edbc2a5ec21a20af&missionId=5f71fe63edbc2a00200e9de0).

## Reflection: Unit 1

The first unit of the course was a driving simulation project. The project was a great introduction to Unity and C#.
The concepts taught are simple enough. I learned the basics of scripting with Unity with this tutorial. Moving forward, I can see that it is important to read the Unity documentation carefully to implement more complex features.
